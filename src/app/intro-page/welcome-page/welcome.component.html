  <div class="center">
    <p>When the US constitution was written in 1787, the Office Of The President was created.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="center">

  <p>To fill this office, every 4 years each state would help to elect a new President.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="center"><img src="../../assets/images/horses.jpg"></div>

  <div class="center">
  <p>Due to the limits of communication and travel, each state had to send Electors to a meeting to record their votes. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
  <p>Large states would get to send lots of electors, and small states would get to send fewer electors.</p>
</div>
<div class="center"><img src="../../assets/images/ElectoralMap.jpg"></div>

<div class="center">
  <p>Today, each state* puts their Electoral Votes toward the candidate that was most popular in the election in their state.
  </p></div> <div class="center">
      <p>   To become president, a candidate needs to receive 270 electoral votes out of the 538.</p>
</div>
<div class="center">
  <h1>What do you do in this game?</h1>
</div>
<div class="center"><img src="../../assets/images/vs.jpg"></div>
<div class="center">
    <p> You will be competing in a 2 party race, meaning that you will run against just 1 opponent. The Republican Party will be represented by the color RED and the Democratic Party will be represented by the color BLUE.</p>
</div>
<div class="center"><img src="../../assets/images/options.png"></div>

<div class="center">
    <p> Your job in this game is to win enough States/Electoral Votes to become president. You can raise money, spend it on advertisements, travel to states for campaign events, and weigh in on national issues to become more popular -- and win the election in states. The game will last 16 turns, so use every move wisely.</p></div>

    <div class="center"><img src="../../assets/images/score.png"></div>

    <div class="center">


   <p> You will see how popular you are in a states shown as a Percentage.  (A +3% means you are predicted to win that state by 3% of the vote. A state that is EVEN could vote for either candidate on election day.)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="center"><img src="../../assets/images/map.png"></div>

  <div class="center">
      <p> You will be given a map that shows how close the race is in each state (based on real past elections data), as well as how many votes you could gain by winning that state.</p></div>

      <div class="center">

       <p> It is a good idea to check in on this often, and use it to decide which states you are going to target in your campaign.</p>

    <div class="center">
        <p> Good luck! If you need any more info, check out the HELP tab during a game</p>
